# Objects and Data Structures

There is a reason that we keep our variables private. We donâ€™t want anyone else to depend on them. We want to keep the freedom to change their type or implementation on a whim or an impulse.

 * *Data Abstraction*

Important note on variable privacy - Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables. Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. Rather it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without having to know its implementation.

Consider Listing 6-3 and Listing 6-4. The first uses concrete terms to communicate
the fuel level of a vehicle, whereas the second does so with the abstraction of percentage.
In the concrete case you can be pretty sure that these are just accessors of variables. In the
abstract case you have no clue at all about the form of the data.

*6.3 - Concrete vehicle*
```
public interface Vehicle {
  double getFuelTankCapacityInGallons();
  double getGallonsOfGasoline();
}
```

*6.4 - Abstract Vehicle*
```
public interface Vehicle {
  double getPercentFuelRemaining();
}
```

In both of the above cases the second option is preferable. We do not want to expose the details of our data. Rather we want to express our data in abstract terms. This is not merely accomplished by using interfaces and/or getters and setters. Serious thought needs to be put into the best way to represent the data that an object contains. The worst option is to blithely add getters and setters.

* *Data/Object Anti-Symmetry*

Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions. Go back and read that again. Notice the complimentary nature of the two definitions. They are virtual opposites. This difference may seem trivial, but it has far-reaching implications.

*The Law of Demeter*

There is a well-known heuristic called the Law of Demeter2 that says a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates. As we saw in the last section, objects hide their data and expose operations. This means that an object should not expose its internal structure through accessors because to do so is to expose, rather than to hide, its internal structure.

*Conclusion*

Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing objects. Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing functions.

In any given system we will sometimes want the flexibility to add new data types, and so we prefer objects for that part of the system. Other times we will want the flexibility to add new behaviors, and so in that part of the system we prefer data types and procedures. Good software developers understand these issues without prejudice and choose the approach that is best for the job at hand.
